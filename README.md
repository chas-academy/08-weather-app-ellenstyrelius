## Rain or Shine - weather forecast app

### see the deployed site [here](https://rainorshine.netlify.com/)

The app uses data from [Dark Sky API](https://darksky.net/dev/docs) and [Bing Maps Location API](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/bingmaps/rest-services/locations/?toc=https%3A%2F%2Fdocs.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fbingmaps%2Frest-services%2Ftoc.json&bc=https%3A%2F%2Fdocs.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2FBingMaps%2Fbreadcrumb%2Ftoc.json) so to get the code to work you need keys from both of them.
